    Dear Ayymean,
    <br>
    I want you to see this whenever you feel overwhelmed, stressed or afraid. 
    I love how you try even though you don't want to and that you have a pizza addiction.
    I am mesmerized by the fact on you how you value your friendships and that being with them allows to recharge and recouperate.
    Sometimes I know you are going through a hard time and I am here to support you. I know that I am not perfect and truth be told
    when I said that "I don't talk to many guys" comment it was insensitive of me. I'm working through it and I promise I will be better.
    Lastly our meets are a treasure for me as I enjoy your company more so I get to understand you more.
    <br>
    I hope this isn't too much
    <br>
    Always
    Your Favorite Looser ;p
